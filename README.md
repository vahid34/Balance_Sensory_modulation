# Balance_Sensory_modulation

Welcome to the repository for the "Sensory Modulation of Gait Balance in Human Locomotion: A Neuromusculoskeletal Modeling Study" paper. Here, you will find all the codes and data used in our research, which investigates the role of sensory feedback in gait balance and control through neuromusculoskeletal simulations.
